            <h3>Academics: Our story resonates with you. We were knee deep in the process of finding funding using industry standard software for our own projects, and realized the need for better solutions. Other Grant software required one to work much harder and spend much more time than was necessary, and we wanted a solution. Hence, <i>Grant Us Funding</i> was born.
            <br/>  
            <br/> 
        There are multiple oppotunities for funding that often times go unrequested. In the current academic environment, funders are actively seeing their next opportunity: From Research to accelerating Fellowships, and much, much more. Advance your research now!</h3>
