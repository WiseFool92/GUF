<h3>Where is my data stored?</h3>
<br/> 
<p>Once data is added to your account, it's stored in our (need to say 3rd party) secure online servers. All files stored online by Grant Us Funding are encrypted and kept in secure storage servers.</p> 
<p>Storage servers are located in data centers across the United States. Additionally, storage servers are available and may be used in other countries.</p>
<br/> 
<h3>How Grant Us Funding keeps your files secure</h3>
<br/> 
<p>Grant Us Funding houses your valuable searches and keeps track of your saved grant files. To maintain safety, Grant Us Funding is designed with multiple layers of protection, distributed across a scalable, secure infrastructure. These layers of protection include:</p> 
<ul style={accounts}> 
    <li>Grant Us Funding files at rest are encrypted using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</li>                         
    <li>Grant Us Funding uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect data in transit between Grant Us Funding apps and our servers.</li>                         
    <li> SSL/TSL creates a secure tunnel protected by 128-bit or higher Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption.</li>                         
    <li>Grant Us Funding applications and infrastructure are regularly tested for security vulnerabilities, and hardened to enhance security and protect against attacks.
    </li>                         
    <li>Two-step verification is available for an extra layer of security at login.</li>                         
    <li> If you use two-step verification, you can choose to receive security codes by text message or from an authenticator app.</li>                         
    <li>Public files are only viewable by people who have a link to the file(s). This will only happen if your share a link to your data. </li>                         
</ul>
<br/> 
<h2 style={accordionH2}>Who can see my data in my Grant Us Funding account?</h2>
<br/> 
<p>All files you store in Grant Us Funding are private. Other people can't see and open those files unless you share links to your files or have teammates whose access is determined by your Admin individual.</p> 
<p>Like most major online services, Grant Us Funding personnel will, on rare occasions, need to access users’ file content <strong>(1)</strong> when legally required to do so; <strong>(2)</strong> when necessary to ensure that our systems and features are working as designed (e.g., debugging performance issues, making sure that our search functionality is returning relevant results, developing image search functionality, refining content suggestions, etc.); or <strong>(3)</strong> to enforce our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy. Access to users’ file content is limited to a small number of people. We have strict policy and technical access controls that prohibit access to file content except in these rare circumstances. In addition, we use a number of physical and electronic security measures to protect user information from unauthorized access.</p> 
<p>Note: If you're a member of a Grant Us Funding team, your Admins and fellow Team Members can access the files in your Team account.</p>
<br/> 
<h3>How long does Grant Us Funding keep my files after I delete my account?</h3> 
<p>When you delete your Grant Us Funding account, we will initiate deletion of your data that’s stored on our servers after ~ 30 days.  Only your admin can disable the account and delete all  data. As a team member you can delete your own individual data.</p>
