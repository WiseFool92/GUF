<h3>Education Pathway</h3> 
<p>
    Two options: <strong>Essential Start</strong> & <strong>Enterprise</strong> Plans. Each has its own set of options, which can be seen in our Plans & Pricing page.
</p> 
<p>
    At Grant Us Funding we recognize that many of you will have different needs. We can offer a custom set of plan options. Simply drop us a line at <a href='mailto: support@GrantUsFunding.com'>support@GrantUsFunding.com</a>.
</p> 
<p>
    Effective differences between Plans: The <strong>Essential Start</strong> plan is ideal for small groups, while the <strong>Enterprise</strong> plan is designed for larger organizations with more Users and Projects.
</p> 
<h3>Upgrades:</h3>
<p>
    Your Admin can make a change between the two plans in their portal. When upgrading from the Essential Plan to the Enterprise plan, a message will be sent to our Support team and your Admin will receive a call and an email. We will send you an Upgrade form that will ask about your needs. You’ll receive a call within a week to confirm that we have all needed information and you’ll receive our quote.
</p> 
<p>All data in your Essential Plan will migrate to the Enterprise version.</p> 
<h3>Downgrades:</h3>
<p>
    To downgrade from the Enterprise to the Essential plan, you can migrate 5 Projects and 5 Users. If you have more than this amount in either Projects or Users, we will contact you and determine the best route for your needs.
