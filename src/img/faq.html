                <p>In our Education Pathway, we offer two options: the <strong>Essential Start</strong>  and <strong>Enterprise plans</strong>. Each has its own set of options, which can be seen in our <strong><a href="plansandpricing.html">Plans & Pricing</a></strong>  page.</p>
                <p>At Grant Us Funding we recognize that many of you will have different needs. We can offer a custom set of plan options. Simply drop us a line at <a href="mailto: support@GrantUsFunding.com">support@GrantUsFunding.com</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Effective differences between Plans:</strong> The <strong>Essential Start</strong> plan is ideal for small groups, while the <strong>Enterprise</strong>  plan is designed for larger organizations with more Users and Projects.</p>
               <p><strong>Upgrades:</strong> Your Admin can make a change between the two plans in their portal. When upgrading from the Essential Plan to the Enterprise plan, a message will be sent to our Support team and your Admin will receive a call and an email. We will send you an Upgrade form that will ask about your needs. You’ll receive a call within a week to confirm that we have all needed information and you’ll receive our quote.</p> 
              <p>All data in your Essential Plan will migrate to the Enterprise version.</p>
              <p><strong>Downgrades:</strong> To downgrade from the Enterprise to the Essential plan, you can migrate 5 Projects and 5 Users. If you have more than this amount in either Projects or Users, we will contact you and determine the best route for your needs.</p>

              <h2>Secure your Grant Us Funding Account</h2>
              <p>A password is always necessary to connect to a Grant Us Funding account. Your password may be recorded in your browser or password program if you gave it permission.</p>
              <p>It’s also possible that someone has access to your email and password. If you see activity on your account that you don’t recognize, secure your Grant Us Funding account by following these steps:</p>
              <ol class="fqa-steps">
                <li>Login to your portal.</li>
                <li>Change your password immediately.</li>
                <li> If you can’t access your account because the message you receive indicates a mismathc of our password, go to the reset password button. You should receive an email with further instruction. If you don’t receive it,  please check your Spam folder before contacting us. If you’re unable to reset your password and gain reentry into your account, please contact us at <a href="mailto: service@GrantUsFunding.com">service@GrantUsFunding.com</a> and let us know ASAP.</li>
                <li> If you can access your account, check that your data is intact.</li>
                <li> When in your portal, for extra security you may want to change the email settings in addition to your password. </li><br>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>If you receive a password or email change notification, but didn't reset it yourself:</strong></p><br>
              <p>If you unexpectedly received a password or email change notification, first verify that the email really came from Grant Us Funding. To be safe, don't click any links in the email—there's always a chance that the email is a fake, sent by phishers trying to access your Grant Us Funding account.</p>
              <p>Instead, go to Grant Us Funding.com and see if you can sign in to your account using your original password. (You may need to sign out first if you're already signed in).If you can sign in, then your password was never changed, and you should ignore that (likely) fake email. Forward the entire email to <a href="mailto: abuse@GrantUsFunding.com"></a> abuse@GrantUsFunding.com and we'll investigate.</p>
              <p>If you can't sign in, then you should first go to the Grant Us Funding login and click the Forgot your password button. Try to reset your Grant Us Funding password as soon as possible.  Use the link in an email from Grant Us Funding to reset your password. (RS NOTE: i think most forgot password reset emails use a link in an email to verify? not sure).</p><br>
              <p><strong>What if the email address on my account was also changed?
              </strong></p><br>
              <p>If both your email address and password have been changed, you may need additional help from us.</p>
              <p>If you haven't yet done so, contact us by going to the contact us link in the header on our website. (Note: Be sure to let us know that you've already tried each of the steps listed in this article. We'll then do our best to assist.)</p><br>
              <p><strong>What should I do if I suspect an unauthorized person accessed my Grant Us Funding account?</strong></p><br>
              <p>If you suspect that an unauthorized person may have accessed your Grant Us Funding account, take the following precautions as soon as possible:
              </p>
              <ul class="accounts">
                <li>Change your Grant Us Funding password on GrantUsFunding.com. Be sure to use a strong password that you don't use for any other service.
                </li>
                <li>Change the password to the email account you use for your Grant Us Funding account. Also, consider setting up two-step verification, which adds an extra layer of security to your account even if your password is somehow compromised.</li>
              </ul><br>
                <h2>Where is my data stored?</h2><br>
                <p>Once data is added to your account, it's stored in our (need to say 3rd party) secure online servers. All files stored online by Grant Us Funding are encrypted and kept in secure storage servers.</p>
                <p>Storage servers are located in data centers across the United States. Additionally, storage servers are available and may be used in other countries.</p><br>
                <p><strong>How Grant Us Funding keeps your files secure</strong></p><br>
                <p>Grant Us Funding houses your valuable searches and keeps track of your saved grant files. To maintain safety, Grant Us Funding is designed with multiple layers of protection, distributed across a scalable, secure infrastructure. These layers of protection include:</p>
                <ul class="accounts">
                  <li>Grant Us Funding files at rest are encrypted using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</li>
                  <li>Grant Us Funding uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect data in transit between Grant Us Funding apps and our servers.</li>
                  <li> SSL/TSL creates a secure tunnel protected by 128-bit or higher Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption.</li>
                  <li>Grant Us Funding applications and infrastructure are regularly tested for security vulnerabilities, and hardened to enhance security and protect against attacks.
                  </li>
                  <li>Two-step verification is available for an extra layer of security at login.</li>
                  <li> If you use two-step verification, you can choose to receive security codes by text message or from an authenticator app.</li>
                  <li>Public files are only viewable by people who have a link to the file(s). This will only happen if your share a link to your data. </li>
                </ul><br>
                <h2>Who can see my data in my Grant Us Funding account?</h2><br>
                <p>All files you store in Grant Us Funding are private. Other people can't see and open those files unless you share links to your files or have teammates whose access is determined by your Admin individual.</p>
                <p>Like most major online services, Grant Us Funding personnel will, on rare occasions, need to access users’ file content <strong>(1)</strong> when legally required to do so; <strong>(2)</strong> when necessary to ensure that our systems and features are working as designed (e.g., debugging performance issues, making sure that our search functionality is returning relevant results, developing image search functionality, refining content suggestions, etc.); or <strong>(3)</strong> to enforce our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy. Access to users’ file content is limited to a small number of people. We have strict policy and technical access controls that prohibit access to file content except in these rare circumstances. In addition, we use a number of physical and electronic security measures to protect user information from unauthorized access.</p>
                <p>Note: If you're a member of a Grant Us Funding team, your Admins and fellow Team Members can access the files in your Team account.</p><br>

              <h2>Where is my data stored?</h2><br>
                <p>Once data is added to your account, it's stored in our (need to say 3rd party) secure online servers. All files stored online by Grant Us Funding are encrypted and kept in secure storage servers.</p>
                <p>Storage servers are located in data centers across the United States. Additionally, storage servers are available and may be used in other countries.</p><br>
                <p><strong>How Grant Us Funding keeps your files secure</strong></p><br>
                <p>Grant Us Funding houses your valuable searches and keeps track of your saved grant files. To maintain safety, Grant Us Funding is designed with multiple layers of protection, distributed across a scalable, secure infrastructure. These layers of protection include:</p>
                <ul class="accounts">
                  <li>Grant Us Funding files at rest are encrypted using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</li>
                  <li>Grant Us Funding uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect data in transit between Grant Us Funding apps and our servers.</li>
                  <li> SSL/TSL creates a secure tunnel protected by 128-bit or higher Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption.</li>
                  <li>Grant Us Funding applications and infrastructure are regularly tested for security vulnerabilities, and hardened to enhance security and protect against attacks.
                  </li>
                  <li>Two-step verification is available for an extra layer of security at login.</li>
                  <li> If you use two-step verification, you can choose to receive security codes by text message or from an authenticator app.</li>
                  <li>Public files are only viewable by people who have a link to the file(s). This will only happen if your share a link to your data. </li>
                </ul><br>
                <h2>Who can see my data in my Grant Us Funding account?</h2><br>
                <p>All files you store in Grant Us Funding are private. Other people can't see and open those files unless you share links to your files or have teammates whose access is determined by your Admin individual.</p>
                <p>Like most major online services, Grant Us Funding personnel will, on rare occasions, need to access users’ file content <strong>(1)</strong> when legally required to do so; <strong>(2)</strong> when necessary to ensure that our systems and features are working as designed (e.g., debugging performance issues, making sure that our search functionality is returning relevant results, developing image search functionality, refining content suggestions, etc.); or <strong>(3)</strong> to enforce our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy. Access to users’ file content is limited to a small number of people. We have strict policy and technical access controls that prohibit access to file content except in these rare circumstances. In addition, we use a number of physical and electronic security measures to protect user information from unauthorized access.</p>
                <p>Note: If you're a member of a Grant Us Funding team, your Admins and fellow Team Members can access the files in your Team account.</p><br>
                
                  <p><strong>How long does Grant Us Funding keep my files after I delete my account?</strong></p>
                  <p>When you delete your Grant Us Funding account, we will initiate deletion of your data that’s stored on our servers after ~ 30 days.  Only your admin can disable the account and delete all  data. As a team member you can delete your own individual data.</p><br>

              <p>On a Grant Us Funding Team, there are <strong>Admins</strong> and <strong>Team Members</strong>. Admins can manage membership to the team, change settings, and manage billing. Grant Us Funding recommends that all Grant Us Funding paid accounts have at least two Admins. The Team Admin has global rights and the Co-Admin/s will be assigned their roles by the Team Admin. If you’re a solo team, you are automatically assigned as Team Admin and will not need additional members to start your subscription.</p>
              <p>Admins on a paid Grant Us Funding plan will have global permissions (as a team Admin) or a more limited set of permissions (as user Co-Admin).  The Co-Admin’s roles will be assigned by the Team Admin.</p><br>

              <h2>What is Natural Language Processing?</h2>
              <p>Have you ever wondered how smart technology can really get, given that the majority of human knowledge is contained within the written word? </p>
              <p>Take the study of Linguistics and combine it with Computer Science. Add a dash of Information Engineering and some Artificial Intelligence, and you get Natural Language Processing.</p>
              <p>It’s all about programming software to process and analyze large amounts of Natural Language data, and make that information available and useful with context.</p><br>
              <p><strong>So, what does this have to do with grants?</strong></p>
              <p>Digital information is only useful when we derive an understanding of the interactions, the context, and then make those translations understood.</p>
              <p>When you look for a grant match, it’s essential to be able to describe your project in detail.  Generally, the more specific your work is to the intent of the grantor, the higher the potential for funding.</p><br>
              <p><strong>How our Grant Matching Works</strong></p>
              <p>When combined with your starting Keywords, the NLP-enabled system provides a shortcut between you and the funding you need.</p>
              <p>Our Data Search returns suggested Data Keywords relevant to your starting input. Don’t waste time combing through endless lists and fields; with our software, you’re directed straight to additional Keywords that are found in similar grants. Then we focus your results, maximizing your opportunities for successful funding. And this is only the start of our smarter technology.</p><br>

              <p> <strong>Your Grant Probability Score (GPS)</strong> is based on a multiple factors.

              <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong></p>
              <p>Your time and effort should be focused on the highest potentials for success. The funding opportunities that you and the grantor are as close to in sync as possible. </p>
